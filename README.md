# README 
I’ve been an EDI auditor for the last 4 years while earning my bachelors degree in Psychology. After graduating I realized psychology wasn’t the field that I preferred to be in. It took me a year and a half to make a career change. I tried the Grow with Google Data Analytic course however that wasn’t a good fit for me. A year later it led me to Front End Software Development. As of right now I know how to create a repository. As of right now I’m in the process of understanding and learning JavaScript.
